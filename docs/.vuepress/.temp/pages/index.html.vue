<template><div><h1 id="hello-nerds" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hello-nerds"><span>Hello nerds</span></a></h1>
<p>I code on occasion, believe it or not. My latest deal is I'm making as many useful things with Java and Github as humanly possible. I also have some non-coding things that I update on occasion, for example my blog repo.</p>
<p>Wish you have a nice day.</p>
